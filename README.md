# THIS IS WILL BE ARCHIVED SOON IF THE DEVELOPERS OF ECHELON DONT SUPPORT FIREFOX 128 THERE ARE SO MANY BETTER FUCKING OPTIONS JUST USE GECKIUM BECAUSE ECEHLON IS FUCKING DEAD FROM WHAT IT SEEMS

# EchelonAustralisAmbienceFix

# THIS HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED ON UBUNTU 22.04 USING THE UNITY DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT IT PROBABLY WILL WORK ON UBUNTU 17.10/18.04 AMBIENCE AND I ONLY PLAN TO HAVE SUPPORT FOR AMBIENCE

NOTE THIS ONLY FIXES THE AUSTRALIS ONE BECAUSE THATS THE ONLY ONE THATS HORRIBLE ON AMBIENCE THEME

it will take me like a day to update this each time they update since i gotta test everything to make sure it works and I actually have a life so yeah

this is echelon https://github.com/echelon-theme/echelon

and i only provided the chrome folder so you still need to download the defaults and config.js file from echelon
